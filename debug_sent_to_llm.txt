Welcome to Flask
================

.. image:: _static/flask-horizontal.png
    :align: center

Welcome to Flask's documentation. Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework.
It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to
complex applications.

Get started with :doc:`installation`
and then get an overview with the :doc:`quickstart`. There is also a
more detailed :doc:`tutorial/index` that shows how to create a small but
complete application with Flask. Common patterns are described in the
:doc:`patterns/index` section. The rest of the docs describe each
component of Flask in detail, with a full reference in the :doc:`api`
section.

Flask depends on the `Werkzeug`_ WSGI toolkit, the `Jinja`_ template engine, and the
`Click`_ CLI toolkit. Be sure to check their documentation as well as Flask's when
looking for information.

DOC 2 - File: docs/installation.rst
Installation
============


Python Version
--------------

We recommend using the latest version of Python. Flask supports Python 3.9 and newer.


Dependencies
------------

These distributions will be installed automatically when installing Flask.

* `Werkzeug`_ implements WSGI, the standard Python interface between
  applications and servers.
* `Jinja`_ is a template language that renders the pages your application
  serves.
* `MarkupSafe`_ comes with Jinja. It escapes untrusted input when rendering
  templates to avoid injection attacks.
* `ItsDangerous`_ securely signs data to ensure its integrity. This is used
  to protect Flask's session cookie.
* `Click`_ is a framework for writing command line applications. It provides
  the ``flask`` command and allows adding custom management commands.
* `Blinker`_ provides support for :doc:`signals`.

DOC 3 - File: docs/extensions.rst
Extensions
==========

Extensions are extra packages that add functionality to a Flask
application. For example, an extension might add support for sending
email or connecting to a database. Some extensions add entire new
frameworks to help build certain types of applications, like a REST API.


Finding Extensions
------------------

Flask extensions are usually named "Flask-Foo" or "Foo-Flask". You can
search PyPI for packages tagged with `Framework :: Flask <pypi_>`_.


Using Extensions
----------------

Consult each extension's documentation for installation, configuration,
and usage instructions. Generally, extensions pull their own
configuration from :attr:`app.config <flask.Flask.config>` and are
passed an application instance during initialization. For example,
an extension called "Flask-Foo" might be used like this::

    from flask_foo import Foo

    foo = Foo()

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config.update(
        FOO_BAR='baz',
        FOO_SPAM='eggs',

    object.  It is passed the name of the module or package of the
    application.  Once it is created it will act as a central registry for
    the view functions, the URL rules, template configuration and much more.

    The name of the package is used to resolve resources from inside the
    package or the folder the module is contained in depending on if the
    package parameter resolves to an actual python package (a folder with
    an :file:`__init__.py` file inside) or a standard module (just a ``.py`` file).

    For more information about resource loading, see :func:`open_resource`.

    Usually you create a :class:`Flask` instance in your main module or

        information and a lot more.

        So it's important what you provide there.  If you are using a single
        module, `__name__` is always the correct value.  If you however are

DOC 1 - File: docs/patterns/index.rst
Patterns for Flask
==================

Certain features and interactions are common enough that you will find
them in most web applications. For example, many applications use a
relational database and user authentication. They will open a database
connection at the beginning of the request and get the information for
the logged in user. At the end of the request, the database connection
is closed.

These types of patterns may be a bit outside the scope of Flask itself,
but Flask makes it easy to implement them. Some common patterns are
collected in the following pages.

Application Structure and Lifecycle
===================================

Flask makes it pretty easy to write a web application. But there are quite a few
different parts to an application and to each request it handles. Knowing what happens
during application setup, serving, and handling requests will help you know what's
possible in Flask and how to structure your application.


Application Setup
-----------------

The first step in creating a Flask application is creating the application object. Each
Flask application is an instance of the :class:`.Flask` class, which collects all
configuration, extensions, and views.

.. code-block:: python

    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config.from_mapping(
        SECRET_KEY="dev",
    )
    app.config.from_prefixed_env()

    @app.route("/")
    def index():
        return "Hello, World!"

This is known as the "application setup phase", it's the code you write that's outside
any view functions or other handlers. I... [truncated]

structured approach. This means that the tutorial will require a bit of
boilerplate up front, but it's done to avoid many common pitfalls that
new developers encounter, and it creates a project that's easy to expand

====== Prompt Sent to LLM for Question: "What dependencies does this project have?" ======

System Prompt:
You are a technical analyst providing detailed information about the repository pallets_flask by pallets.
            
            For this specific question: "What dependencies does this project have?"
            
            Your task is to provide a comprehensive, accurate answer based ONLY on the context provided.
            
                Guidelines for this dependency-related question:
                - List all external dependencies/libraries used by the project
                - Identify the primary/core dependencies
                - Note any dependency management tools used (npm, pip, etc.)
                - Mention any version constraints or requirements
                - Group related dependencies by their purpose if possible
                
                General guidelines:
                - Base your answer ONLY on the provided context
                - If the context doesn't contain enough information, say so clearly
                - Cite specific file names when relevant
                - Organize your answer in a clear, structured format
                - Be specific and comprehensive
                - Focus on factual information from the repository

## DOCUMENTATION CONTEXT

DOC 1 - File: docs/patterns/packages.rst
does not want modules in packages to be the startup file.  But that is not
a big problem, just add a new file called :file:`pyproject.toml` next to the inner
:file:`yourapplication` folder with the following contents:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    name = "yourapplication"
    dependencies = [
        "flask",
    ]

    [build-system]
    requires = ["flit_core<4"]
    build-backend = "flit_core.buildapi"

Install your application so it is importable:

.. code-block:: text

    $ pip install -e .

To use the ``flask`` command and run your application you need to set
the ``--app`` option that tells Flask where to find the application
instance:

.. code-block:: text

    $ flask --app yourapplication run

What did we gain from this?  Now we can restructure the application a bit
into multiple modules.  The only thing you have to remember is the
following quick checklist:

1. the `Flask` application object creation has to be in the
   :file:`__init__.py` file.  That way each mod... [truncated]

* `python-dotenv`_ enables support for :ref:`dotenv` when running ``flask``
  commands.
* `Watchdog`_ provides a faster, more efficient reloader for the development
  server.

greenlet
~~~~~~~~

You may choose to use gevent or eventlet with your application. In this
case, greenlet>=1.0 is required. When using PyPy, PyPy>=7.3.7 is
required.

These are not minimum supported versions, they only indicate the first
versions that added necessary features. You should use the latest
versions of each.


Virtual environments
--------------------

Use a virtual environment to manage the dependencies for your project, both in
development and in production.

What problem does a virtual environment solve? The more Python projects you
have, the more likely it is that you need to work with different versions of
Python libraries, or even Python itself. N... [truncated]


DOC 3 - File: docs/extensiondev.rst
    The tests must be part of the sdist distribution.
7.  A link to the documentation or project website must be in the PyPI
    metadata or the readme. The documentation should use the Flask theme
    from the `Official Pallets Themes`_.
8.  The extension's dependencies should not use upper bounds or assume
    any particular version scheme, but should use lower bounds to
    indicate minimum compatibility support. For example,
    ``sqlalchemy>=1.4``.
9.  Indicate the versions of Python supported using ``python_requires=">=version"``.
    Flask itself supports Python >=3.9 as of October 2024, and this will update
    over time.

## CODE IMPLEMENTATION CONTEXT

CODE 1 - File: src/flask/sansio/app.py
Def: App
```
class App(Scaffold):
    """The flask object implements a WSGI application and acts as the central
    object.  It is passed the name of the module or package of the
    application.  Once it is created it will act as a central registry for
    the view functions, the URL rules, template configuration and much more.

    The name of the package is used to resolve resources from inside the
    package or the folder the module is contained in depending on if the
    package parameter resolves to an actual python package (a folder with
    an :file:`__init__.py` file inside) or a standard module (just a ``.py`` file).

    For more information about resource loading, see :func:`open_resource`.

    Usually you create a :class:`Flask` instance in your main module or
    in the :file:`__init__.py` file of your package like this::

        from flask import Flask
        app = Flask(__name__)

    .. admonition:: About the First Parameter

        The idea of the first parameter is to give Flask an idea of what
        belongs to your application.  This name is used to find resources
        on the filesystem, can be used by extensions to improve debugging
        information and a lot more.

        So it's important what you provide there.  If you are using a single
        module, `__name__` is always the correct value.  If you however are
        using a package, it's usually recommended to hardcode the name of
        your package there.

structured approach. This means that the tutorial will require a bit of
boilerplate up front, but it's done to avoid many common pitfalls that
new developers encounter, and it creates a project that's easy to expand
on. Once you become more comfortable with Flask, you can step out of
this structure and take full advantage of Flask's flexibility.

Welcome to Flask
================

    :align: center

Welcome to Flask's documentation. Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework.
It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to
complex applications.

Get started with :doc:`installation`
and then get an overview with the :doc:`quickstart`. There is also a
more detailed :doc:`tutorial/index` that shows how to create a small but
complete application with Flask. Common patterns are described in the
:doc:`patterns/index` section. The rest of the docs describe each
component of Flask in detail, with a full reference in the :doc:`api`
section.

Flask depends on the `Werkzeug`_ WSGI toolkit, the `Jinja`_ template engine, and the
`Click`_ CLI toolkit. Be sure to check their documentation as well as Flask's when
looking for information.

Handling Application Errors
===========================

Applications fail, servers fail. Sooner or later you will see an exception
in production. Even if your code is 100% correct, you will still see
exceptions from time to time. Why? Because everything else involved will
fail. Here are some situations where perfectly fine code can lead to server
errors:

-   the client terminated the request early and the application was still
    reading from the incoming data
-   the database server was overloaded and could not handle the query
-   a filesystem is full
-   a harddrive crashed
-   a backend server overloaded
-   a programming error in a library you are using
-   network connection of the server to another system failed

And that's just a small sample of issues you could be facing. So how do we
deal with that sort of problem? By default if your application runs in
production mode, and an exception is raised Flask will display a very simple
page for you and log the exception to the :a... [truncated]


DOC 2 - File: CHANGES.rst
-   Deprecated ``init_jinja_globals``. Override the
    ``Flask.create_jinja_environment`` method instead to achieve the
    same functionality.
-   Added ``safe_join``.
-   The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
    mimetype parameter.
-   Don't modify the session on ``get_flashed_messages`` if there are no
    messages in the session.
-   ``before_request`` handlers are now able to abort requests with
    errors.
-   It is not possible to define user exception handlers. That way you
    can provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain
    errors that might occur during request processing (for instance
    database connection errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
-   Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
-   Implemented generic class-based views.

## DOCUMENTATION CONTEXT

DOC 1 - File: docs/deploying/index.rst
Deploying to Production
=======================

After developing your application, you'll want to make it available
publicly to other users. When you're developing locally, you're probably
using the built-in development server, debugger, and reloader. These
should not be used in production. Instead, you should use a dedicated
WSGI server or hosting platform, some of which will be described here.

"Production" means "not development", which applies whether you're
serving your application publicly to millions of users or privately /
locally to a single user. **Do not use the development server when
deploying to production. It is intended for use only during local
development. It is not designed to be particularly secure, stable, or
efficient.**

Self-Hosted Options
-------------------

Flask is a WSGI *application*. A WSGI *server* is used to run the
application, converting incoming HTTP requests to the standard WSGI
environ, and converting outgoing WSGI responses to HTTP responses.

Deploy to Production
====================

This part of the tutorial assumes you have a server that you want to
deploy your application to. It gives an overview of how to create the
distribution file and install it, but won't go into specifics about
what server or software to use. You can set up a new environment on your
development computer to try out the instructions below, but probably
shouldn't use it for hosting a real public application. See
:doc:`/deploying/index` for a list of many different ways to host your
application.


Build and Install
-----------------

When you want to deploy your application elsewhere, you build a *wheel*
(``.whl``) file. Install and use the ``build`` tool to do this.

.. code-block:: none

    $ pip install build
    $ python -m build --wheel

You can find the file in ``dist/flaskr-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl``. The
file name is in the format of {project name}-{version}-{python tag}

Installation
============


Python Version
--------------

We recommend using the latest version of Python. Flask supports Python 3.9 and newer.


Dependencies
------------

These distributions will be installed automatically when installing Flask.

* `Werkzeug`_ implements WSGI, the standard Python interface between
  applications and servers.
* `Jinja`_ is a template language that renders the pages your application
  serves.
* `MarkupSafe`_ comes with Jinja. It escapes untrusted input when rendering
  templates to avoid injection attacks.
* `ItsDangerous`_ securely signs data to ensure its integrity. This is used
  to protect Flask's session cookie.
* `Click`_ is a framework for writing command line applications. It provides
  the ``flask`` command and allows adding custom management commands.
* `Blinker`_ provides support for :doc:`signals`.

.. _Werkzeug: https://palletsprojects.com/p/werkzeug/
.. _Jinja: https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/
.. _MarkupSafe: https://palletsprojects.... [truncated]


DOC 3 - File: docs/extensiondev.rst
    The tests must be part of the sdist distribution.
7.  A link to the documentation or project website must be in the PyPI
    metadata or the readme. The documentation should use the Flask theme
    from the `Official Pallets Themes`_.
8.  The extension's dependencies should not use upper bounds or assume
    any particular version scheme, but should use lower bounds to
    indicate minimum compatibility support. For example,
    ``sqlalchemy>=1.4``.
9.  Indicate the versions of Python supported using ``python_requires=">=version"``.
    Flask itself supports Python >=3.9 as of October 2024, and this will update
    over time.

            Behavior was simplified. The logger is always named
            ``"flask.app"``. The level is only set during configuration,
            it doesn't check ``app.debug`` each time. Only one format is
            used, not different ones depending on ``app.debug``. No
            handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no

    ``JSONDecoder`` classes, are deprecated. JSON behavior can now be
    overridden using the ``app.json`` provider interface. :pr:`4692`
-   ``json.htmlsafe_dumps`` and ``json.htmlsafe_dump`` are deprecated,

-   Fixed a error reporting bug with ``Config.from_envvar``.
-   Removed some unused code.
-   Release does no longer include development leftover files (.git

    .pyc files)


Version 0.3
-----------

Released 2010-05-28, codename Schnaps

-   Added support for categories for flashed messages.
-   The application now configures a ``logging.Handler`` and will log
    request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug mode.
    This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors for
    example.
-   Added support for context binding that does not require the use of
    the with statement for playing in the console.
-   The request context is now available within the with statement
    making it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
-   Added support for configurations.
